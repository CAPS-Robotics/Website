            <h5>What We've Been doing in Our Community</h5>
            <div>
                <p><b>Orphan Run</b> <small class="date">September 2013</small></p>
                <p>The Orphan Run was a chance for the community to come together to raise money for the less fortunate youth in the Kansas City area. A plethora of booths with activities for children was set up with the intent of encouraging children to take advantage of various activities. We set up a booth allowing students to control our competition robots, as well as discussed the importance of STEM education at a young age.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p><b>Operation Breakthrough</b> <small class="date">October 2012</small></p>
                <p>We paired with the organization Operation Breakthrough, which specializes in mentoring and providing education for children trapped in poverty. We went downtown to their facility in Kansas City to give a presentation about engineering and demo our robot, as well as answer any questions the kids had. Operation Breakthrough has been focused on bringing information and, by extension, passion and curiosity about STEM to kids who otherwise would have little to no exposure to such opportunities. It has not only been an eye-opening experience for the kids, but also an entirely new sort of experience for us.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p><b>HALO</b> <small class="date">October 2013</small></p>
                <p>Team 2410 invited the students of the Helping Art Liberate Orphans (HALO) Organization to CAPS, the team's work base. They worked alongside members of the team in order to complete engineering-like challenges such as toothpick tower building and a classic paper airplane contest for mini-prizes. Giving underprivileged students the opportunity to explore engineering and its possibilities was an incredibly special experience to the HALO students and team as well.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p><b>NASCAR</b> <small class="date">2010 - 2015</small></p>
                <p>The Metal Mustangs began discussion with the NASCAR arena in Kansas City in 2011 in the hopes of procuring a booth at their events. Since then, we have braved Kansas's temperamental weather twice a year to take our robots to Kansas Speedway. In a tent across from the Ford booth, we have had the chance to meet thousands of NASCAR fans, telling them who we are and what we do as well as giving demonstrations of both our robots from previous years and FLL 'bots. Through this NASCAR event, we have also discovered mentors for our team, networked with FLL coaches, and opened the door for further opportunities in mentoring FLL teams, including finding four of the teams that we have recently worked with.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p><b>FLL Scrimmage</b> <small class="date">November 2012 - 2015</small></p>
                <p>In 2014, Team 2410 hosted its third annual FLL Scrimmage. We gathered approximately fifteen FLL (elementary level) teams and gave them an opportunity to practice for their regional competitions. Not only there are they offered the opportunity to practice for matches, but Metal Mustangs members mentor the younger teams and also judge their presentational and teamwork events. This completely student-organized and student-run event is always successful, and the kids really enjoy the chance to talk to the older students who have been through the same robotics program for many years. ​</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p><b>Sporting KC</b> <small class="date">September 2013 - 2014</small></p>
                <p>At one soccer game this past year, Team 2410 has hosted a booth near the entrance to the Sporting KC soccer stadium. There we answered questions and gave demonstrations of our robots. The interactions with the kids is what made the event truly enjoyable. Drawn to our booth by the intrigue of the robots, the kids were always excited, fascinated, and abuzz with wonder. We then had the opportunity to talk to them, answer their questions, encourage them in their enthusiasm, and even giving them first-hand experience with FIRST and robotics as we guided them through how to drive the robots. This has become an annual event. ​</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p><b>Harvester's</b></p>
                <p>For the past two years, beginning in 2012, members of Team 2410 have collected cans, sorted them, and boxed them for storage in Harvester's storerooms. The food drive has proven to be successful, with the number of cans that we have collected growing every year. The crowning point was in 2012, when the team provided enough cans for our goal of exactly 2,410 meals, just from collections in our hometown Kansas City.</p>
