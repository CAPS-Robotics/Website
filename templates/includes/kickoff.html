<p>On Saturday, January 7th, we will be having our FRC Kickoff. FIRST broadcasts our challenge for the season at this time, so we will be watching the game video, and then discussing the game and strategy. <b>We will start meeting at 9am in the CAPS Atrium (just walk in the door and you can't miss us) and will go until 3pm at the latest.</b> We will have a lot of cinnamon rolls for breakfast and pizza for lunch. We hope to see you all there!</p>
