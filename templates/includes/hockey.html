<p>The Metal Mustangs got a special opportunity to demonstrate our 10 barrel t-shirt bot at the KC Mavericks hockey game February 1st. The Mustangs competed against fellow FRC team 1810 for the title of crowd favorite. Thanks to our sponsors who made this all possible and a special thanks to Midwest Aquatics who gave us the Scuba Tanks!</p>
