<p>We are FRC Team 2410, The Metal Mustangs, from the Blue Valley School District in Overland Park, Kansas. Our robotics team competes in FIRST (For the Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) Robotics Competitions. In FRC, high school students worldwide build a robot in a 6-week time span for the year's competition. We are dedicated to providing opportunities for high school students to explore applications of science and technology as well as achieving personal growth and learning. Watch our Chairman's video below for some interviews from students and mentors that really explain the feel of the team.</p>
