<p>We have kicked off the 2018 season, FIRST Power Up! We are now meeting 6-8pm Monday through Thursday and 9-3pm on Saturdays. Our meetings are always at the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Blue+Valley+Center+for+Advanced+Professional+Studies/@38.8563848,-94.6720727,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x9b19a16f336e50a3!8m2!3d38.8563848!4d-94.6720727">Blue Valley CAPS</a> Facility.</p>
<p>We understand if you will not be able to attend every meeting. Schoolwork definitely comes first, but we would like to see you whenever you are able to attend.</p>
